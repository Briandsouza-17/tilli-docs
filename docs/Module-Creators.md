# Module Creators
For those organisations or individuals with development background who are interested to create more content or modules in the web-app can do so via the IDE. 

## IDE: 

### Introduction 
(What it is, How it works, What it has)

The IDE is a prototyping platform that allows one to create, customize and upload one’s own content and curriculum for children to interact with via a web-app.


### Features available inside the IDE

There are 3 main sections that one needs to work with inorder to create a complete module:

- Image Manager
- Theme
- Module

A module comprises of a set of screens called theme that uses assets like images, animations (only gifs) etc.

#### Image Manager 

The image manager is a section in the IDE where you can upload and store the following types of assets: images, videos, gifs and audio.

These are the assets that you will use when creating a screen aka theme.

Available Features:

You can upload and store the following files and file types:

- Image: 
    - .jpg, 
    - .png
- Video: 
    - .mp4
- Gif: .
    - gif
- Audio: 
    - .mp3

Please ensure that you use only the above file types for your assets else they cannot be uploaded and stored.

Remember to also upload images of your screens into the Image Manager for reference purposes.

#### Theme

Theme is a section in the IDE where you can create all your screens one at a time with the relevant content, user interface, assets from the Image Manager and assign specific actions. 

Available Features:

There are three types of themes:

- Static

This option allows you to create a screen using just an image and cannot have any other function besides moving on to the next screen on tapping

Unique Tracking tags cannot be added to a static screen

- Dynamic

This option allows you to create layers that can be triggered on tapping any sort of assets added on the theme like a specific image or UI etc.

For example: Using a Dynamic theme, you can create a screen that has Multiple choice question where clicking on one answer will reveal whether the answer is correct or wrong via another layer and then on clicking next button, it will take you to the next screen.

Unique Tracking Tags can be added to a dynamic screen

- Godot

This option allows you to upload a zipfile of a game created in Godot. You can integrate the game in the IDE via Module

#### Module

Module is a section in the IDE where you can compile all the screens you have created in the theme section in the order of your choice to make one complete game/curriculum.

### How to create your own module

This section is still work in progress and will be further extended & improved.
