# Project Charter

### ABOUT TILLI

Build a global open source community to localize and deliver equitable and culturally relevant SEL content at scale. This will make social emotional learning more accessible to teachers, parents and kids in countries and communities around the world with Tilli serving as a major resource post-covid to close specific learning gaps in schools and in the home for kids ages 5-10.

Tilli creates a scalable design system for educators and developers to quickly build customized social emotional learning with curated inputs from a range of stakeholders including girls, those with disabilities, those living in poverty, from rural and urban areas, and conflict zones.


### COMMUNITY STATEMENT 

Tilli actively reaches out to identify and build community among parents, caregivers, kids, educators, developers, designers, language workers, and community leaders. Tilli uses an inclusive community building approach to nurture under-resourced languages and emphasize inputs from girls, those with disabilities, from rural and urban areas, and conflict zones. This enables Tilli to meet the needs of our stakeholders in a variety of languages and communities. Our stakeholders include girls in rural communities, under-resourced languages and kids with disabilities and those living in conflict zones.

By submitting :
- developer feedback;
- culturally relevant design feedback on the needs of different communities, and languages;
- insights from parents, caregivers, teachers on types of learning loss experienced post-covid;
- types of supports needed to overcome this learning loss
- feedback on the impact of learning loss to the community from local leaders
Each of these and additional stakeholders become active participants in the development and design of the Tilli content. This is valuable because the content becomes informed and stewarded by the community for the community. This makes it much more likely that Tilli will be relevant to the communities it serves so it can grow and be successful one community at a time.

The values of each community will be reflected using this process while the voice of each community is amplified. This will inspire and motivate additional communities to come forward and engage with Tilli and strengthen the kids in their community to ensure their lifelong success.
