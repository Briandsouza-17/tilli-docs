### ABOUT TILLI

Build a global open source community to localize and deliver equitable and culturally relevant SEL content at scale. This will make social emotional learning more accessible to teachers, parents and kids in countries and communities around the world with Tilli serving as a major resource post-covid to close specific learning gaps in schools and in the home for kids ages 5-10.
