## How to translate
 
### Here are some pointers to keep in mind while translating our content:

- Translation should use a conversation tone for kids to understand easier
- The simple the words are the better (kids vocabulary)
- Words that are repeated across the different products should have the same translation (for consistency)
- Shorter sentences the better (wherever possible)
- Feel free to give us feedback on the content in English. We shall do our best to improve the same :)
