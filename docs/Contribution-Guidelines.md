We have created guidelines for contributing to Tilli project and packages. These are guidelines, not rules. We encourage you to use your best judgment, and feel free to recommend changes to this document in a pull request. We use [GitHub](https://github.com/tillioss) to host code, to 	track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests:
The best way to contribute to this project is by making a pull request in following ways:
- Fork the Tilli project and work on your fork
- Create a new branch on which you want to make changes - “git checkout -b ‘my-contribution’” or push your changes on develop branch
- Please make one pull request per issue to avoid large merges.
- Commit your change with a commit message describing the correction.
- Submit a pull request against the Tilli repository. 
- In general, all pull requests must:
  - Have a clear use case, fix a demonstrable bug or serve the greater good of the project
  - Have unit tests, where appropriate;
  - Follow code style guidelines
  - Not break the existing test suite
  - Where bugs are fixed, where possible, there should be unit tests demonstrating the bug and also proving the fix. This helps prevent regression.
  - Change relevant comments and documentation when the behavior of code changes.

### Report Bugs & Issues
If you find any bug and you're not sure how to fix it, or you don't know how to do a pull request, then you can create an Issue. Filing an Issue will help us see the problem and fix it. Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. After you've determined which repository your bug is related to, create an issue on that repository and provide the following information. A contributor is invited to create an issue, discuss it, and provide a fix if needed.
